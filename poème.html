		<h1><center><b>POÈME</b></center></h1>
	           <p>Dear Basketball,<br>From the moment<br>  I started rolling my dad’s tube socks<br>
                And shooting imaginary<br>
                Game-winning shots<br>
                In the Great Western Forum<br>
                I knew one thing was real:<br>
                
                I fell in love with you.<br>
                
                A love so deep I gave you my all —<br>
                From my mind & body<br>
                To my spirit & soul.<br>
                
                As a six-year-old boy<br>
                Deeply in love with you<br>
                I never saw the end of the tunnel.<br>
                I only saw myself<br>
                Running out of one.<br>
                
                And so I ran.<br>
                I ran up and down every court<br>
                After every loose ball for you.<br>
                You asked for my hustle<br>
                I gave you my heart<br>
                Because it came with so much more.<br>
                
                I played through the sweat and hurt<br>
                Not because challenge called me<br>
                But because YOU called me.<br>
                I did everything for YOU<br>
                Because that’s what you do<br>
                When someone makes you feel as<br>
                Alive as you’ve made me feel.<br>
                
                You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream<br>
                And I’ll always love you for it.<br>
                But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.<br>
                This season is all I have left to give.<br>
                My heart can take the pounding<br>
                My mind can handle the grind<br>
                But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.<br>
                
                And that’s OK.<br>
                I’m ready to let you go.<br>
                I want you to know now<br>
                So we both can savor every moment we have left together.<br>
                The good and the bad.<br>
                We have given each other<br>
                All that we have.<br>
                
                And we both know, no matter what I do next<br>
                I’ll always be that kid<br>
                With the rolled up socks<br>
                Garbage can in the corner<br>
                :05 seconds on the clock<br>
                Ball in my hands.<br>
                5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1<br>
                
                Love you always,<br>
                Kobe
            </p>
